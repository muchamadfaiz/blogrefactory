### Introduction

![intro](/img/test.png)

The MERN stack is a popular stack of technologies nowadays for building a modern single-page application. The main purpose of using the MERN stack is to develop apps using javascript only. This is because the four technologies that make up the technology stack are all JavaScript-based. Thus, if one knows JavaScript (and JSON, the backend, frontend, and database can be operated easily.

The MERN stack consists of the following technologies:

* **M -** MongoDB: A document-based database.
* **E -** Express: A server-side web framework.
* **R -** React: A client-side web framework.
* **N -** Node.js: JavaScript run-time environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser (such as a server).

Using (MERN) makes us easily build a three-tiers architecture (front end, back end, and database) entirely using JavaScript and JSON.
